# MCP Reasoner
A systematic reasoning MCP server implementation for Claude Desktop featuring both Beam Search and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) capabilities.

## Features
* Dual search strategies:
   * Beam search with configurable width
   * MCTS for complex decision spaces
* Thought scoring and evaluation
* Tree-based reasoning paths
* Statistical analysis of reasoning process
* MCP protocol compliance

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Jacck/mcp-reasoner.git
cd mcp-reasoner
npm install
npm run build
```

## Configuration
Add to Claude Desktop config:
```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-reasoner": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/mcp-reasoner/dist/index.js"],
    }
  }
}
```

## Search Strategies

### Beam Search
* Maintains fixed-width set of most promising paths
* Optimal for step-by-step reasoning
* Best for: Mathematical problems, logical puzzles

### Monte Carlo Tree Search
* Simulation-based exploration of decision space
* Balances exploration and exploitation
* Best for: Complex problems with uncertain outcomes

**Note:** Monte Carlo Tree Search allowed Claude to perform really well on the Arc AGI benchmark (scored 6/10 on the public test), whereas beam search yielded a (3/10) on the same puzzles. For super complex tasks, you'd want to direct Claude to utilize the MCTS strategy over the beam search.

## Algorithm Details
1. Search Strategy Selection
   * Beam Search: Evaluates and ranks multiple solution paths
   * MCTS: Uses UCT for node selection and random rollouts
2. Thought Scoring Based On:
   * Detail level
   * Mathematical expressions
   * Logical connectors
   * Parent-child relationship strength
3. Process Management
   * Tree-based state tracking
   * Statistical analysis of reasoning
   * Progress monitoring

## Use Cases
* Mathematical problems
* Logical puzzles
* Step-by-step analysis
* Complex problem decomposition
* Decision tree exploration
* Strategy optimization

## Future Implementations
* Implement New Algorithms
   * Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)
   * Alpha-Beta Pruning
